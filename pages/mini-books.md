I have started writing long-form content more times than I can count. A full book on Confluence. A complete guide to interviews. A proper deep dive into OKRs. Each time, somewhere between chapter three and chapter five, the thing I was writing about changed enough to make the earlier chapters feel stale. Or I changed. Or I realized the scope was so large that finishing it would take longer than the topic stayed relevant.

Mini-books are the answer I landed on.

# What a Mini-Book Is

A mini-book is a short, structured collection of chapters on one topic. Not a blog post — those are too loose and tend to disappear into a feed. Not a full book — those take long enough to write that they are already partially outdated by the time they are done.

A mini-book has enough structure to be useful as a reference and short enough to actually be finished. Most of them are between three and seven chapters. Some are one. A few will probably never get past two.

The format is not the point. The point is having something complete enough to hand to someone and say: here, this covers the basics.

# Why Things Deprecate

Technical content has a shelf life. Confluence changes its interface. Jira renames features. A workflow that was the right answer in 2022 is the wrong one in 2024. A 200-page book about a specific tool is a liability — you either maintain it forever or you let it rot.

Shorter content rots more gracefully. A three-chapter guide can be updated one chapter at a time. If something becomes outdated, the useful parts still stand. The scope is small enough that keeping it current is not a second job.

# Who This Is For

Primarily, me.

I come back to these pages when I have forgotten how something works, or when I need to explain it to someone quickly and do not want to reconstruct the explanation from memory. Having it written down means I think through it properly once and benefit from that thinking every time after.

But if someone else finds one of these useful — even one person, even once — that is worth more than leaving the knowledge inside my head where nobody else can reach it. Most of what ends up here came from someone else originally. Writing it down and making it findable is a way of passing it on.

# Why Not Just Blog Posts

Blog posts are formatted for discovery. They need hooks and SEO and a reason for someone to land on them from a search engine. Mini-books are formatted for use. They assume the reader is already there and wants to get through the material efficiently.

The chapter structure also forces a kind of clarity. When you have to split something into chapters, you have to decide what belongs in each one. That process surfaces gaps and redundancies in ways a single long post does not. Writing in chapters is thinking in chapters.

# The Status Colors

Every mini-book has a status:

- **Green**: complete enough to share without disclaimers
- **Yellow**: draft — the ideas are there but the writing still needs work
- **Orange**: jottings — rough notes that could become a book someday
- **Red**: barely started — a title and a direction, not much else

Most things live at yellow. That is fine. Done is better than perfect, and yellow is honest.
