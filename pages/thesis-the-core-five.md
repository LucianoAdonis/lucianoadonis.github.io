~~Life it's like a game of chess, I don't know how to play chess.~~

I’ve had my fair share of onboardings and interviews, and one thing that always stands out is how often the aim feels just a little off.

It reminds me of a blog I read some time ago, with a title that really stuck with me: “Companies Don’t Need Geniuses.” That sentiment perfectly captures the heart of what’s often wrong with role expectations.

If you find yourself needing to hire a genius to fill a position, it’s likely for one of two reasons: you’re genuinely pushing the boundaries of innovation—or you’re chasing unicorns.
