~~Life it's like a game of chess, I don't know how to play chess.~~

I've had my fair share of onboardings and interviews, one thing that always sticks is that sometimes the aim is a little of.

It reminds me of that blog that I read a while ago sometime, the title summarizes everything "Companies don't need geniuses" which apply very well when discussing about the expectations of a position.

If you need to hire a genius to work with you, you either are pushing the boundaries of innovation or just searching for unicorns.
