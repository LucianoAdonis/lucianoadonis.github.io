# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

Jekyll and GitHub Pages look limited at first glance. Pick a theme, write some Markdown, done. But once you start pushing against the defaults, you realize there is a lot of room to make things feel like your own.

This mini-book collects the small things that are not obvious from the documentation: how the repository is structured, what front matter parameters actually do, and how to reach past Markdown into HTML when you need more control over layout, images, or formatting.

If you are setting up a GitHub Pages site for the first time, or you already have one and want to understand how this one works under the hood, this is for you.

- [Chapter 2: HTML](/pages/markdown-chapter-2): Going beyond standard Markdown: tab names, favicons, color references, expandable blocks, and image formatting.
