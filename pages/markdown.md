# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

I thought at first that templates and Jekyll were limited, but that's not true! It can do a lot more, but rarely you get the chance to do more interesting things.

# Chapters Overview

The content will be split into four sections, as the index bar exceeded its length, making it easier to read and navigate:

- [Chapter 0: Setup](pages/markdown-chapter-0): 
- [Chapter 1: Repository](/pages/markdown-chapter-1):
- [Chapter 2: HTML](/pages/markdown-chapter-2):
