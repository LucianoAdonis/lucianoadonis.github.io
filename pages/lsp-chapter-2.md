# What Can I tell?

- Value for the client.

# What I Want to Do it?

Besides forcing coworkers to play at my level, both literally and nonleretally.

But in reallity I was trying to find answers to:

- *When no one sees you, what will you do?*
- How can I lift others?
- 

# Analogies

As there isn't a straight way to explain it, I'll pull some random analogies that I can think of and pray that it's enough to convey the potential.

## A Facilitator is a Dungeon Master

The certification trains you to become a **Dungeon Master** (DM) (Facilitator). The DM is responsible for creating scenarios based on the team/business’ needs, guiding events, and drawing out participant insights accordingly.

Much like a D&D campaign, participants can contribute their ideas to the process, and it’s up to the Facilitator to either incorporate them or set them aside constructively.

Fortunately—or unfortunately—as a participant, you don’t have to roleplay a character. Instead, participants use metaphors to express their ideas through what they build.

Odd comparisons aside, working with physical objects offers perspectives that aren’t always easy to access otherwise. This process leads to meaningful insights and creative solutions as participants construct both their inner and external worlds in a way that contributes to the bigger picture.

That's one reason it helps team bonding, as you will get to know the other participants better, what inspires and motivates them, and more.

A certified DM it's suggested, because at this level of play, you can draw the worst nightmares of the participants for the sake of it, instead to help them.

## A Board Game

When we sit down and think of our existence, most of things can be described as a game. A board game like chess has it's complexities, but once you understand the rules, at least you can play it. Depending on the level, you will have a predefined set of movements or be in charge of other pieces, or the match entirely.

But when organizations are added to the mix, we are now playing 4D chess, and blaming the past and future.
