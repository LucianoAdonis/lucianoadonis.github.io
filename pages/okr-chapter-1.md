# What is an OKR?

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are tools for setting goals and establishing clear metrics to gauge progress. They help articulate what you aim to achieve (Objectives) and how success will be measured (Key Results). This framework helps organizations align goals across teams, ensuring everyone works towards the same outcomes with measurable results.

<br>

## How Does an OKR Look?
An OKR format typically follows:

I will (Objective) as measured by (Key Results).

For instance, consider the OKR: “I will enhance the user experience on our website,” as measured by “achieving a user satisfaction rate of 70%, reducing load time to under one second, and cutting down error rates to less than 1%.”

This format clearly lays out the intention and the criteria for measuring its success, making it an effective tool for driving performance improvements.

# Do OKRs Have Timelines?
OKRs are typically time-bound, often structured around quarterly cycles. However, the starting month of Q1 can vary, aligning with an organization's fiscal calendar rather than the calendar year. This adaptability ensures that OKRs are seamlessly integrated into different operational schedules and business environments, allowing for periodic reassessment and recalibration of strategies and goals.

OKRs can be carried over to subsequent periods based on factors like the nature of the objective, progress achieved, and strategic priorities. Carrying over may occur if objectives are incomplete due to ambitious goals, long-term projects, or unexpected challenges

When considering carrying over an OKR, it's important to:

- Review and Rationale: Assess the reasons for carrying over, whether due to unrealistic planning, external factors, or because the objective spans a long term.
- Update and Adapt: Modify key results to reflect new insights or changes in the business environment.
- Communication: Clearly explain the reasons for carrying over to all stakeholders to ensure transparency and maintain engagement.
- Integration with New Goals: Align carried-over OKRs with new organizational goals to keep the strategic direction cohesive.

This strategic decision helps ensure that OKRs remain relevant and continue to drive meaningful progress, rather than being seen as routine or unattainable.

## Fiscal Year

The quarterly months in a fiscal year can vary depending on when a company's fiscal year begins. Below is a general outline of how quarters are distributed based on different starting months of the fiscal year:

Standard Calendar Year (January Start)
- Q1: January, February, March
- Q2: April, May, June
- Q3: July, August, September
- Q4: October, November, December


Fiscal Year Starting in October (Common in U.S. Federal Government)
- Q1: October, November, December
- Q2: January, February, March
- Q3: April, May, June
- Q4: July, August, September

Fiscal Year Starting in April (Common in India and Japan)
- Q1: April, May, June
- Q2: July, August, September
- Q3: October, November, December
- Q4: January, February, March

Fiscal Year Starting in July (Common in Australia)
- Q1: July, August, September
- Q2: October, November, December
- Q3: January, February, March
- Q4: April, May, June


Organizations might choose a different start month for their fiscal year based on regulatory requirements, industry practices, or strategic considerations. This decision can affect how the fiscal quarters are distributed across the calendar year.

# How Does Jira Relate to OKRs?
In many organizations, Jira is used to track the progress of OKRs. Managers and product owners often utilize Jira to create Epics that represent each OKR. These Epics serve as central hubs for organizing tasks, monitoring progress, and aligning team efforts with strategic objectives.

By categorizing work into different Epics, teams—whether in development, infrastructure, or other areas—can better reflect their specific contributions to the overarching goals of the company.
