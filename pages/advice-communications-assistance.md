### Channel Selection Guidelines

1. **Private Group** (for initial triage):
   - Single environment impact
   - Minor component affected
   - Limited scope (< 5 people)
   - Uncertain team ownership
   
2. **Public Channel** (mandatory for):
   - Multi-environment impact
   - Critical component affected
   - Multiple teams involved
   - Potential widespread impact
   - Escalated incidents

### Team Engagement Protocol

1. **Development Team Engagement**:
   - Post in squad's dev channel
   - Tag relevant subject matter experts
   - Include:
     - Error logs
     - Environment details
     - Recent changes
     - Impact assessment

2. **Infrastructure Team Engagement**:
   - Contact current on-call engineer first
   - Provide:
     - Infrastructure metrics
     - Alert screenshots
     - Access issues
     - System health indicators

3. **Cross-team Collaboration**:
   - Create war room if needed
