# Usernames



# Email (GMAIL)

Your identity. 

Using the `+` sign gives you a infinite possibilities.

For anything {{ site.vars.example_email }}

## Labels

Label email work in more way besides having everything look tight, it also helps to do some verifications, like a sender.

Unsuscribe for god's sake.

## Unsubscribe

Rather than making labels for everything subscribing may be a better way.

## Account Separation

Basically, whenever you share it, you will get more spam, and separating things may be best in the long run.

## Security

If having an additional phone for shopping is not your cup of TEA, having fisical keys, at least two of them.

## Forward Account

An account to receive notifications in insecure mobile.

- Rules to prevent.
- In case of emergency stop the forwarding rule.



# Social Presence

Besides RRHH which I sugest you avoiding. I recommend you to have a linktree or Carrdco site to have your personal links.
