# Why Use ADRs?

In large-scale enterprise environments, architectural decisions have far-reaching implications. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) serve as a crucial tool for documenting these decisions, their context, and rationale. They're not just documentation; they're a strategic asset in managing complex systems and teams.

ADRs provide several key benefits in enterprise settings:

- üß† Collective Knowledge Repository: Preserve the context and reasoning behind major technical decisions.
- ü§ù Cross-Team Alignment: Ensure consistency across multiple teams and departments.
- üîÆ Future-Proofing: Provide valuable insights for future team members or during system evolutions.
- üìä Informed Decision Making: Encourage thorough consideration of options and their enterprise-wide impact.
- üè¢ Scalable Knowledge Management: Ensure critical decisions are documented and accessible as the organization grows.

Implementing ADRs is an investment in your organization's technical governance and long-term architectural integrity.

# Structure

Based on extensive experience with enterprise-scale systems, we've developed a comprehensive ADR format that balances detail with clarity:

1. üéØ Problem Statement
2. ü§î Considered Options
3. üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture
4. üí• Impact Analysis
5. üöÄ Implementation Plan
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Mitigations
7. ‚úÖ Compliance and Governance

## Problem Statement
Clearly articulate the issue at hand and its business context.

Key points to consider:
- Context: What business or technical factors led to this decision point?
- Objectives: What specific, measurable goals are we aiming to achieve?
- Scope: Is this a new implementation or an enhancement of an existing system?
- Stakeholders: Which teams or business units will be affected?

Example:
```
Our current monolithic application is struggling to scale with our growing user base. Response times have increased by 40% in the last quarter, and deploying new features has become a time-consuming process, often requiring full system restarts. We need to explore options to improve scalability and deployment efficiency without disrupting our existing user experience.
```

<br>

<br>

## Considered Options
Provide a balanced analysis of the alternatives considered.

Key points to consider:
- Alternatives: What options did the architecture team evaluate?
- Pros and Cons: What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?
- Constraints: How do our current technology stack and enterprise standards influence these choices?
- Total Cost of Ownership: What are the long-term implications for maintenance and scalability?

Example:
```
We considered three main options:
1. Vertical Scaling: Simply increasing our server capacity.
   Pros: Quick to implement, no architectural changes.
   Cons: Costly, doesn't solve underlying issues.

2. Microservices Architecture: Breaking our monolith into smaller, independent services.
   Pros: Improved scalability, easier deployments.
   Cons: Complex to implement, requires significant refactoring.

3. Serverless Architecture: Moving to a fully managed, event-driven model.
   Pros: High scalability, pay-per-use pricing.
   Cons: Vendor lock-in, potential cold start issues.
```

## Proposed Architecture
Detail the recommended solution and its alignment with enterprise architecture.

Key points to consider:
- Solution Overview: Provide a high-level description of the proposed architecture.
- Technology Stack: What technologies will be used, and how do they fit into our enterprise landscape?
- Scalability and Performance: How will this solution meet our growth projections?
- Security and Compliance: How does this solution address our enterprise security requirements?

Example:
```
We propose adopting a microservices architecture, gradually breaking down our monolith into smaller, independently deployable services. We'll start by extracting our user authentication and product catalog as separate services, using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. This approach allows us to:
- Scale services independently based on demand
- Deploy updates more frequently with less risk
- Improve fault isolation

We'll use an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices, maintaining a single entry point for our clients.
```

## Impact Analysis
Time to put on your fortune-teller hat. What ripples will this decision create across our tech ocean?

Key points to consider:
- Downtime: Will there be any service interruptions? How can we minimize them?
- Performance: How will this affect system speed and efficiency?
- Risks: What could go wrong, and how likely is it?
- Team Involvement: Which teams will be affected, and how?
- Business Impact: How does this align with broader company goals?
- Metrics: What KPIs will help us measure success?
- Cost Implications: Both immediate and long-term financial considerations.
- Reversibility: If things go south, how easily can we roll back?

Example:
```
The transition to microservices will have several impacts:
- Performance: We expect a 30% improvement in response times for our most used features.
- Team Structure: We'll need to reorganize into cross-functional teams aligned with specific services.
- Learning Curve: The team will need training in microservices patterns, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Costs: Initial development costs will increase, but we anticipate long-term savings in scaling and maintenance.
```

## Implementation Plan
Plot the course from decision to implementation. This is your roadmap to success.

Key points to consider:
- Timeline: Key milestones and deadlines.
- Roles and Responsibilities: Who's doing what?
- Testing Strategy: How will we ensure everything works as expected?
- Phased Rollout: Are we going all-in or taking a gradual approach?
- Training Needs: Do we need to upskill the team?
- Feedback Loop: How will we gather and incorporate user/team feedback?
- Contingency Plans: What's our backup if things don't go as planned?
- Communication Strategy: How will we keep stakeholders informed?

Example:
```
Our adoption plan spans 6 months:
Month 1-2: Team training and proof of concept
Month 3-4: Extract authentication service, test in production with 10% of traffic
Month 5-6: Extract product catalog, gradually increase traffic to new services

We'll use feature flags to easily roll back if we encounter issues, and we'll hold weekly team meetings to address challenges and share learnings.
```

## Risks and Mitigations
Learn from the past to build a better future. Document the stumbling blocks we've already identified.

Key points to consider:
- Encountered Issues: What problems have we already run into?
- Root Causes: Why did these issues occur?
- Workarounds: How did we solve or mitigate these problems?
- Lessons Learned: What can other teams take away from our experience?
- Potential Pitfalls: What should future implementers watch out for?
- Improvement Opportunities: How can we do better next time?

Example:
```
During our proof of concept, we encountered:
- Data consistency issues between services
- Increased latency due to network calls between services
- Challenges in distributed logging and tracing

We're addressing these by implementing event sourcing for data consistency, optimizing inter-service communication, and adopting a distributed tracing solution.
```

## Compliance and Governance
Dot your i's and cross your t's. Ensure we're aligned with company standards and best practices.

Key points to consider:
- Standard Procedures: Have we followed all company-mandated processes?
- Related Resources: Link to relevant docs, MRs, or external references.
- New Documentation: What new guides or wikis need to be created?
- Review Process: Who needs to sign off on this decision?
- Tagging and Categorization: How should this ADR be labeled for easy future reference?
- Announcement Plan: How will we communicate this decision to the wider org?
- Update Cycle: When should this ADR be reviewed and potentially updated?

Example:
```
‚úÖ Architecture review board approval obtained on 2023-06-15
‚úÖ Security team consulted, additional encryption requirements noted
‚úÖ New runbook created for microservices deployment process
‚úÖ Quarterly review scheduled to assess progress and adjust course if needed
```
