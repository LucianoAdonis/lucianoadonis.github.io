# Why Use ADRs?

Picture this: You're troubleshooting a critical system, trying to decipher why someone chose that specific architecture or tech stack. You're digging through layers of code and config files, muttering under your breath, and wishing you could ping the minds of your predecessors to ask, "What was the rationale here?"

That's where ADRs come in. They're not just another artifact in your project repository – they're your lifeline in the complex landscape of technical decisions. And here's the kicker: even if you think you can keep all the details in your head, in larger organizations with multiple teams and complex systems, it's practically impossible. ADRs become invaluable as your projects scale and evolve.

Here's why ADRs are the secret ingredient in any high-performing tech team:

- 🧠 Collective Memory: Preserve the context and reasoning behind major technical decisions.
- 🤝 Team Alignment: Get everyone on the same page, reducing "I thought we were using a different approach" moments.
- 🔮 Future-Proofing: Help future team members (or your future self) understand past architectural and implementation choices.
- 📊 Better Decision Making: Encourage thorough consideration of options and their impact on the entire system.
- 🏢 Scaling Knowledge: As your company grows, ADRs ensure critical decisions don't get lost in the noise.

So, next time you're tempted to skip writing an ADR, remember: your future self (or the team that inherits your project) will be immensely grateful. It's not about doubting your memory – it's about creating a reliable system of record that grows with your organization.

# Example

## ADR-001: Transition to Microservices Architecture for E-commerce Platform

### Problem Statement
Our monolithic e-commerce platform is struggling to scale with increased traffic and new feature demands. The current architecture has become a bottleneck for growth and innovation, hindering our ability to respond quickly to market changes. We need a more flexible, scalable architecture that allows for independent service scaling and faster feature development.

Our primary objectives are to improve scalability, reduce time-to-market for new features, and enhance system resilience. This is not a new implementation, but rather an upgrade to our existing system. We expect this change to result in better performance during traffic spikes, faster feature rollouts, and improved fault isolation.

### Considered Options
We explored three main options for addressing our scalability and flexibility challenges:

1. Vertical Scaling of Monolith: While simpler to implement and maintaining our current architecture, this option offers limited scalability and doesn't solve our code complexity issues.

2. Microservices Architecture: This option provides high scalability, allows independent service deployment, and improves fault isolation. However, it increases operational complexity and requires significant refactoring.

3. Modular Monolith: This approach maintains the simplicity of a monolith while improving modularity. However, it doesn't fully address our scalability issues and still has deployment dependencies.

### Proposed Architecture
After careful consideration, we propose transitioning to a microservices architecture. Our approach involves decomposing our monolith into core services: User Service, Product Catalog, Order Management, Payment Processing, and Inventory Management.

We'll use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, leveraging our current Spring Boot knowledge for service development. This architecture allows each service to be independently scaled based on demand. For security, we'll implement OAuth2 for service-to-service authentication and use an API Gateway for external requests.

### Impact
We anticipate minimal downtime during the transition, as we'll use a strangler pattern to gradually replace monolith functionalities. We expect an improvement in response times and the ability to handle traffic spikes. However, we acknowledge the potential for increased network latency and data consistency challenges across services.

This change will require all development teams to adapt to microservices patterns and tools. From a business perspective, this aligns with our goal of rapid innovation and improved customer experience.

### Adoption Plan
We propose a 12-month phased rollout, starting with the Product Catalog service. We'll form a dedicated "Microservices Transition" team to lead the effort. Our testing strategy will include comprehensive integration testing and chaos engineering practices.

The rollout will be gradual, migrating service by service, with parallel running of old and new systems to ensure smooth transitions. We'll conduct workshops on microservices best practices, Docker, and Kubernetes to ensure our team is well-prepared for this architectural shift.

### Known Errors
In our initial testing, we've encountered performance degradation due to network overhead. To mitigate this, we're optimizing inter-service communication and considering the use of gRPC for critical paths. We're also aware of potential data consistency issues in distributed transactions, which we're addressing through careful service boundary design and the implementation of eventual consistency where appropriate.

### Company Checklist
We've reviewed this decision against our company's architectural review process. The CTO and Head of Engineering have signed off on this approach. We've created a new Confluence space for microservices transition documentation and best practices. This ADR will be reviewed quarterly during the transition period to ensure it remains aligned with our goals and to incorporate lessons learned.

Eventually...
