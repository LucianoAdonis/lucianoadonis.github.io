## Unable to Join a Team Meeting

### Key Principles
- Always communicate as early as possible
- Use appropriate channels (prioritize team's Scrum channel)
- Provide clear status updates and next steps
- Tag relevant team members
- Follow up after the meeting

### Communication Channels Priority
1. Team's Scrum/Sprint channel
2. Project-specific channels
3. Direct messages to lead/manager
4. Calendar update/meeting response
