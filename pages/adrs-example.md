## ADR-001: Transition to Microservices Architecture for E-commerce Platform

### Problem Statement
Our monolithic e-commerce platform is struggling to scale with increased traffic and new feature demands. The current architecture has become a bottleneck for growth and innovation, hindering our ability to respond quickly to market changes. We need a more flexible, scalable architecture that allows for independent service scaling and faster feature development.

Our primary objectives are to improve scalability, reduce time-to-market for new features, and enhance system resilience. This is not a new implementation, but rather an upgrade to our existing system. We expect this change to result in better performance during traffic spikes, faster feature rollouts, and improved fault isolation.

<br>

### Considered Options
We explored three main options for addressing our scalability and flexibility challenges:

1. Vertical Scaling of Monolith: While simpler to implement and maintaining our current architecture, this option offers limited scalability and doesn't solve our code complexity issues.

2. Microservices Architecture: This option provides high scalability, allows independent service deployment, and improves fault isolation. However, it increases operational complexity and requires significant refactoring.

3. Modular Monolith: This approach maintains the simplicity of a monolith while improving modularity. However, it doesn't fully address our scalability issues and still has deployment dependencies.

<br>

### Proposed Architecture
After careful consideration, we propose transitioning to a microservices architecture. Our approach involves decomposing our monolith into core services: User Service, Product Catalog, Order Management, Payment Processing, and Inventory Management.

We'll use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, leveraging our current Spring Boot knowledge for service development. This architecture allows each service to be independently scaled based on demand. For security, we'll implement OAuth2 for service-to-service authentication and use an API Gateway for external requests.

<br>

### Impact Analysis
The transition to microservices will have several impacts:
- Performance: We expect a 30% improvement in response times for our most used features.
- Team Structure: We'll need to reorganize into cross-functional teams aligned with specific services.
- Learning Curve: The team will need training in microservices patterns, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Costs: Initial development costs will increase, but we anticipate long-term savings in scaling and maintenance.

<br>

### Implementation Plan
We propose a 12-month phased rollout:
1. Months 1-3: Team training and proof of concept
2. Months 4-6: Extract User Service and Product Catalog, test in production with 10% of traffic
3. Months 7-9: Extract Order Management and Payment Processing
4. Months 10-12: Extract Inventory Management, gradually increase traffic to new services

We'll use feature flags to easily roll back if we encounter issues, and we'll hold weekly team meetings to address challenges and share learnings.

<br>

### Risks and Mitigations
Key risks and mitigation strategies:
1. Data Consistency: Implement event sourcing and CQRS patterns to manage data across services.
2. Performance Overhead: Optimize inter-service communication, consider using gRPC for critical paths.
3. Operational Complexity: Invest in robust monitoring and tracing tools, implement automated deployment pipelines.

### Compliance and Governance
- Architecture review board approval obtained on 2023-06-15
- Security team consulted, additional encryption requirements for inter-service communication noted
- New runbook created for microservices deployment process
- Quarterly review scheduled to assess progress and adjust course if needed
- Compliance team verified that the new architecture meets all regulatory requirements
