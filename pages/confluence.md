## I'm All of Me

When I was in High School, we had to choose between two types of electives: scientific and Humanities. (Some schools have technical specialties, but that wasn't my case.)

You would expect that because I work now in technology or always had that predisposition, I was going to be a scientific student, but nope, I chose Humanities instead.

It wasn't because I was eager to improve my writing skills, read books and poems, and spend time dwelling on finding other meanings in them. I just wanted to be in a class with cute girls, and it seemed like an easy/obvious option.

Thinking back, I was more in line with what you'd expect from the archetype of a Rudeus (Mushoku Tensei), Zenitsu (Demon Slayer), or Mineta (My Hero Academia)—an average teenager. I've come a long way since then—I'm a decent person now. But I digress.

I ended up being dead wrong. It was a lot of work, reading, and making reports about every small thing we read.

What happened was that I had the "luck" that the new teachers were from prestigious Universities and had the mentality of getting everyone at that level before getting into the university. I can remember my classmates excited about that and myself internally screaming.

I just wanted an easy life.

This introduction is to say that I was not born loving writing and reading, so I can understand why most people dislike or want to avoid " spending " time at all costs.

I began to read by my own will when I was about to start university at 17. While working in the summers, I didn't have enough signal to use my phone or other ways to distract myself after working in the summers away from home.

On a side note, thanks to ChatGPT, I have been able to regain and quickly search things that I didn't have mapped, like the following quotes that I couldn't recall fully, but I can summarize everything for you now:

>"The tragedy of reading great works of literature in school is that they are often pushed upon students too early, before they are ready to truly understand or appreciate them." - C.S. Lewis.

>"There are two types of kids. One will say 'Why didn't you make me learn to play the piano?' The other will say 'Why did you make me learn to play the piano?'" - David Foster Wallace

I think I learned a lot from the forewords in science fiction books, where editors shared their thoughts and opinions about the book and other related sources. It was insightful, and I usually skipped those things if they were present during any mandatory High School book.

## Why This Book?

Based on my experience, when you facilitate the patterns and tools to make documenting less taxing, people will be more willing to cooperate and improve things. When they see the value it provides, it is easier to invest time knowing that it will be helpful to someone, even if that person is yourself in the future.

Unless you have read or seen good examples, you probably don’t know how to get to that point or what tools to use to get there or at least closer, so this mini-book tries to solve that!

I’ll try to be as structured as possible when building from scratch rather than trying to jump into complex topics like Dynamic Documentation—oh yes, it gets better.


## How to Use This Book

First I would start advicing to avoid reading this in mobile.

- Highlighted Words: I'll use Tomato color to highlight either concepts or macros and avoid adding hyperlinks everywhere.
- Image Examples:
  - I like the format, but between clicks you can miss some action.
  - Images can be clicked so you can have a good look at them.
- Expandable Code: if it says that you can expand it, then it is an example but not really needed to you look at it.

## Overview of The Chapters

The page distribution will have to be separated in three, as the content length exceeded the index bar, and it will be probably easier this way:

- [Chapter 1: Basics](/confluence-chapter-1): this is the right place to start if you feel a little awkward navigating through Confluence.
- [Chapter 2: Advanced Topics](/confluence-chapter-2): this is where the fun begins. Sections to improve the way that you work with Confluence.
- [Chapter 3: The Empire Strikes Back](/confluence-chapter-3): random trivia that may be helpful in a date.
