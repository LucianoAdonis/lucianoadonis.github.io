# Why This Mini-Book?

Based on my experience, when you facilitate the patterns and tools to make documenting less taxing, people will be more willing to cooperate and improve things. When they see the value it provides, it is easier to invest time knowing that it will be helpful to someone, even if that person is yourself in the future.

Unless you have read or seen good examples, you probably don’t know how to get to that point or what tools to use to get there or at least closer, so this mini-book tries to solve that!

I’ll try to be as structured as possible when building from scratch rather than trying to jump into complex topics like Dynamic Documentation—oh yes, it gets better.

## How to Use This Mini-Book

First, I suggest avoiding reading this on mobile. Second, this mini-book is **focused on the On-Prem version of Confluence**, so there will be some differences in menus and integrations.

In regards to the exposition of the content:

- **Highlighted Words**: I'll use the Tomato color to highlight either concepts or macros and avoid adding hyperlinks everywhere.
- **Image Examples**:
  - I like the format, but you can miss some action between clicks.
  - Images can be clicked to have a good look at them.
- **Expandable Code**: if it says that you can expand it, then it is an example, but you do not need to look at it.

# Chapters Overview

The page distribution will have to be separated in three, as the content length exceeded the index bar, and it will be probably easier this way:

- [Chapter 0: About the Author (optional)](/pages/confluence-chapter-0): read this if you don't believe that you have the skills to write.
- [Chapter 1: Basics](/pages/confluence-chapter-1): this is the right place to start if you feel a little awkward navigating through Confluence.
- [Chapter 2: Advanced Topics](/pages/confluence-chapter-2): this is where the fun begins. Sections to improve the way that you work with Confluence.
- [Chapter 3: The Empire Strikes Back](/pages/confluence-chapter-3): random trivia that may be helpful in a date.
