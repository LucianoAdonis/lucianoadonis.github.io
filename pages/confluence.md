>"To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow." – Audrey Hepburn

Based on my experience, when you facilitate the patterns and tools to make documenting less taxing, people will be more willing to cooperate and improve things. When they see the value it provides, it is easier to invest time knowing that it will be helpful to someone, even if that person is yourself in the future.

Unless you have read or seen good examples, you probably don’t know how to get to that point or what tools to use to get there or at least closer, so this mini-book tries to solve that!

I’ll try to be as structured as possible when building from scratch rather than trying to jump into complex topics like Dynamic Documentation—oh yes, it gets better.

To simplify each section we are going to go for the edition basics in the first part.

I'll skip how to login and click the create a Page.

For advanced topics I'll use Tomato <div style="width: 10px; height: 10px; background-color: #ff6347; display: inline-block; border: 2px solid #000;"></div> color to highlight either concepts or macros and avoid adding hyperlinks everywhere.

The page distribution will have to be separated in three, as the content length exceeded the index bar, and it will be probably easier this way:

- [Chapter 1: Basics](/confluence-chapter-1): this is the right place to start if you feel a little awkward navigating through Confluence.
- [Chapter 2: Advanced Topics](/confluence-chapter-2): this is where the fun begins. Sections to improve the way that you work with Confluence.
- [Chapter 3: The Empire Strikes Back](/confluence-chapter-3): random trivia that may be helpful in a date.
