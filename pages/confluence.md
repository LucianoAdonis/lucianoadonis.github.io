>Writing in Confluence is more like arranging your digital Zen garden, than actually writing. - Luciano Adonis

I've spent so many years with Confluence that I might as well marry it by now. But, sticking to the topic at hand, I've picked up a few tricks that can help your chakras alignt when it comes to Confluence.

To use Confluence you must become the Confluence.

# Page Layout

Often overlooked, but using multiple rows and columns can significantly improve how you display content or highlight key points.
Instead of scrolling through a vertical monolith of text, you can create a more dynamic and engaging layout.

Or just put the 

## Example
The following page, which is a dummy btw (thanks ChatGPT) would be your run of the mill page in Confluence, let's see it!

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/pagelayout-example-1.png" alt="pagelayout-example-1" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">

- It doesn't have cohesion.
- Feels awkward.
- Looks like some pointers from the new hire.

Now let's continue with an "arranged" version of it:

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/pagelayout-example-2.png" alt="pagelayout-example-2" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">

- Could be improved! But it feels more natural and structured. Like they know what they are doing.
- Some extra colors may do some good, but let's keep it simple for now.

So, what happened? A few slight changes with the layout:

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/pagelayout-example-2-explanation.png" alt="pagelayout-example-2-explanation" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">


1. Title was adjusted to Level 3 to not distract from the content.
2. A grid was defined for only that item so it doesn't colide with others.
3. Moved the text to make for a lenghty introduction.
4. Logo is displayed at the side, same size.
5. The Livesearch macro will now have a text to display and its kept under the logo.
6. The grid is 2/3 to have more space to text.
7. The difference with this grid is that it is three columns. Whatever works for you!
8. Sometimes it's simpler to have a grid to act as a separator.


# Macros

Let’s talk Macros—those nifty little tools that can take your pages from “meh” to “wow.” Below is a list of my favorites, but if you’re in a hurry, skip to the [next section](#simple-combination) for the ones that’ll matter most in the short term.

## Simple Combination

If you’ve only got the mental bandwidth for a few Macros, prioritize the following macros to get quick results:

* [Multiexcerpt](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf719/excerpt-macro-1157466743.html): I consider [Multiexcerpt Include](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf719/excerpt-include-macro-1157466741.html) to be part of it, so it counts as one. This will allow you to reuse content in other pages. Like coding!
* [Table Filter](https://docs.stiltsoft.com/tfac/cloud/how-to-use-table-filter-macro-42239756.html): There are such great things that you can do with filters and queries. It's sad that you have to but at least is not painful!
- [ChildTabs](https://docs.bitvoodoo.app/navitabs-tabs-for-confluence-data-center/?utm_source=bv-app&utm_medium=Editor&utm_campaign=Navitabs%20Child%20Tabs%20Macro): For when you’ve got a bunch of subpages—this helps you keep it all organized without endless tabs.

In the following example, the main page "Macros Example" displays two results with the ChildTabs that are the pages under it. The context behind those pages will be explained in the Datasource Page's [example](#example-1), but for know you need two know that those are separated pages loaded simultaneously and quickly accessible through the parent page.

The cross reference between those is not limitated by location but just for simplicity.

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/childtabs-macro-content-side-by-side.png" alt="childtabs-macro-content-side-by-side" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">


# Datasource Pages

Just like it sounds, a Datasource Page is where you consolidate information. With Macros like [Multiexcerpt](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf719/excerpt-macro-1157466743.html) and [Table Include](https://docs.stiltsoft.com/tfac/dc-server/how-to-use-table-excerpt-and-table-excerpt-include-macros-42241623.html), you can save yourself a ton of headaches by keeping your source of truth and attached pages in sync.

If you ever change the name or something on the datasource page, it won’t break the pages that depend on it—it updates automatically. So go ahead, get creative!

## Structure

## Example
The reusable content can be anything that you can place in that box, so be either text or image it can be there. Of course, with the exception of tables which have their own macro to do that.

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/multiexcerpt-example.png" alt="multiexcerpt-example" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">

To include something you have to use the multiexcerpt include macro which will display you the available options in the page and a small preview of the content retrieved:

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/multiexcerpt-include-macro-menu.png" alt="multiexcerpt-include-macro-menu" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">

From the edition menu will look like this:

<img class="myImg" src="../images/confluence/multiexcerpt-include-macro-example.png" alt="multiexcerpt-include-macro-example" style="border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer;">

# Tagging

[Live Search](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf719/livesearch-macro-1157466803.html) gets even better when you’re using proper tagging, so take the time to tag your content wisely.
