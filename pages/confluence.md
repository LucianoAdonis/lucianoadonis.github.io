### Page Layout

### Macros

Let’s talk Macros—those nifty little tools that can take your pages from “meh” to “wow.” Below is a list of my favorites, but if you’re in a hurry, skip to the next section for the ones that’ll matter most in the short term.

- [Multiexcerpt]() : Reuse text and images across pages by naming them.
- [Multiexcerpt Include]() : Import selected multiexcerpts from specified pages.
- [Table Excerpt]() : Reuse tables from one page to another.
- [Table Include]() : Import specific tables from other pages.
- [Table Filter]() : Query data across multiple pages.
- [Live Search]() : Add a search bar with predefined parameters.
- [Query]() : Use `@self` with related tags to filter content.
- [Contributor Summary]() : Display recent updates from a page and its subpages.  
- [Expand Macro]() : Hide content, such as memes, within expandable sections.
- [Page Properties Report]() : Create reports from multiple pages using the Page Properties macro.
- [Definition List]() : Render terms and definitions in a list format.
- [Panel]() : Add a customizable colored panel to format text.
- [Page Properties]() : Combine with Page Properties Report to create a table of information from multiple pages.
- [Excerpt]() : Define a snippet of content for reuse on another page.
- [Live Search]() : Add a customizable search field to a page.
- [Table of Contents]() : Help readers navigate directly to specific sections of a page.
- [Background Color]() : Change the background color of a page.
- [Include Page]() : Display content from another page or blog post.
- [Form]() : Add a text box and submit button for creating a new page, with options for templates or parent pages.
- [Content Report Table]() : Generate a content report in table format based on labels.
- [ChildTabs]() : Navigate between pages easily; view content from child pages without opening multiple tabs.
- [Expand]() : Add expandable/collapsible sections to your page.
- [Alert]() : Create customizable alerts that display when a page loads.


#### Macro Combinations

If you’ve only got the mental bandwidth for a few Macros, prioritize these:

* [Multiexcerpt](): I consider [Multiexcerpt Include]() to be part of it, but this will allow you to reuse content in other pages. Like code!
* [Table Filter](): There are such great things that you can do with filters and queries. It's sad that you have to but at least is not painful!
- [ChildTabs]() : For when you’ve got a bunch of subpages—this helps you keep it all organized without endless tabs.

### Datasource Pages

Just like it sounds, a Datasource Page is where you consolidate information. With Macros like [Multiexcerpt]() and [Table Include](), you can save yourself a ton of headaches by keeping your source of truth and attached pages in sync.

If you ever change the name or something on the datasource page, it won’t break the pages that depend on it—it updates automatically. So go ahead, get creative!

### Tagging

[Live Search]() gets even better when you’re using proper tagging, so take the time to tag your content wisely.

#### What to Look for

We tend to miss a lot of information when we write because we skip the obvious stuff to keep things simple, which isn’t necessarily bad.

Here are some tips:

- Avoid using subtitles for everything—sometimes less is more.
- Think about your approach when writing. Personally, I like to brain-dump everything and then organize it later. Sometimes, I even start with the conclusion. But others might prefer to outline their titles first and work from there.
- When writing, think about the person who’ll be reading this. What will their first thought be? It’s a good practice to assume they’ll have more knowledge gaps than you do, so cover those quickly and clearly.
