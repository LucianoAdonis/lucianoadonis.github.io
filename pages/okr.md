# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

OKRs exist because at some point someone noticed that teams were busy, managers were reporting progress, and yet nothing meaningful was getting done. The framework is an attempt to fix the gap between "we worked on things" and "we moved the needle."

For engineers and leads, the practical value is simpler: when your Jira Epics are tied to Key Results, your work speaks for itself in every status update. You do not have to explain what you did. The numbers do it.

This guide covers how OKRs are structured, how deliverables and Key Results relate to each other, and how to wire Jira so that reporting upward is a matter of pointing at something rather than writing a summary from scratch.
