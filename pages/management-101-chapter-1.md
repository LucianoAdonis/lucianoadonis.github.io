# Why Someone Would Choose This?

I like to think of it as a specialization in your skill tree. If you are like me, you probably have a lot of fun wrestling with code and devs, which leads you to a different speciailization the Subject Matter Expert (SME).

But I chose the Manager Life when planning my career next steps, even though most would assume the obvious move was to double down on what I was already good at. 
Personal experience led me down this path. The reason? Like playing with LEGO, as an SME, you get to design, plan, and build whatever is needed. And that’s fun—competing to create better and faster? That’s my jam! But... I try to be efficient with my time and above else life.

I’ve met great managers who saved me—and our clients—a ton of wasted effort. Chasing the newest tech just for the sake of it? Not always the best play.

So, I’d rather fight smarter... even if that means dealing with more people than machines.
