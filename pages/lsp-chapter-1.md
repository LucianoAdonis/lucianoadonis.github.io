# What it is the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®?

When you search for the meaning and description of **LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® (LSP)**, you’ll come across multiple interpretations—and that’s the beauty of the methodology, it opens up numerous opportunities for deep learning and innovative thinking. With the right guidance, it can also unlock the potential of the people you work with.

**LSP** originated in 2001, created by the **LEGO® Group** to keep up with the growing demand for innovative problem-solving and team-building approaches. However, since 2010 it doesn't longer supports the methodology (LSP V1.0). However, the **LSP Association of Master Trainers** has stepped in to keep it up-to-date, continuously refining and evolving the model.

It's really powerful approach with a wide range of applications, that can foster deep learning and innovative thinking. Moreover, there's an [LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Certification](https://seriousplay.community/usa/certification/) for those who want to master the methodology in the **version 2.0**.


As quoted from the certification site, **LSP** enables individuals and teams to:

- Unlock the potential of people and their values.
- Develop teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal relationships.
- Create and validate business models.
- Facilitate strategic planning meetings.
- Define and refine mission, vision, and organizational values.
- Design innovative products or services.
- Analyze scenarios and explore actionable solutions.


# Why it does it have a certification?

Well, as mentioned before there is a **LSP V1.0** and **V2.0**, you can guess which one it's free. So the certification consists 4-Day 40-Hour Training program that it won't make you an expert but will help you to facilitate the workshops and have the tools to work with them.

## Why Paying for it? It's Open Source

Yes, it’s expensive. And honestly? I’ve already spent ten times that amount on LEGO, so why not go the extra mile and get a certification?

But back to the main topic, as with everything Open Source, there’s a ~~pay-to-win~~ “**Pro**” version with modifications that make it worth it.

Sure, you can dive into the instructions for the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Starter Kit (15 minutes) or explore the [Open Source Guide](https://davidgauntlett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LEGO_SERIOUS_PLAY_OpenSource_14mb.pdf) (40 minutes at worst). It’s a solid starting point, but it won’t answer the really important questions, like:

- How do I gain both practical experience and theoretical knowledge?
- How do I lead a session?
- How do I manage participants?
- What should my behavior be during a session?
- What happens if X does Y, and Z isn’t happy about it?
- How do we manage time~~ and space~~?
- Where can I find predefined exercises with detailed steps?
- Can I get custom materials?

These are the gaps that Version 2.0, along with the training, aims to bridge. It’s not just about having a framework—it’s about learning the techniques and striving to master them.


## Where do I get it?

For North and Central America you can contact them directly, but for South America you will have to get to them through official Partners like [Meraki Consultores](https://merakiconsultores.cl/lego-seriousplay/).
