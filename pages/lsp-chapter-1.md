# What it is the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®?

When you search for the meaning and description of **LSP**, you’ll come across multiple interpretations—and that’s the cool part of the methodology, it opens up numerous opportunities for deep learning and innovative thinking. With the right guidance, it can also **unlock the potential** of the people you work with.

**LSP** originated in 2001, created by the **LEGO® Group** to keep up with the growing demand for innovative problem-solving and team-building approaches. However, since 2010 it doesn't longer supports the methodology (LSP V1.0), though it continues to sell the LEGO® sets used in the process. For more details, see [Chapter 3](./lsp-chapter-3).

The **LSP Association of Master Trainers** now maintains and develops **Version 2.0** of the methodology, introducing improvements based on feedback from practitioners and facilitators.

For those who want to learn this methodology, there's the training program to get the [LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Certification](https://seriousplay.community/usa/certification/).


<br>

## What Can It Really Do?

As quoted from the official site, **LSP** enables individuals and teams to:

- Unlock the potential of people and their values.
- Develop teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal relationships.
- Create and validate business models.
- Facilitate strategic planning meetings.
- Define and refine mission, vision, and organizational values.
- Design innovative products or services.
- Analyze scenarios and explore actionable solutions.

The versatility of the methodology and all of the knowledge that it is behind it, it's quite impressive. If applied well, you can get results that you wouldn't thought possible in a year, just in a few days.

# Why Should I Take The Certification?

Well, as mentioned before there is a **LSP V1.0** and **V2.0**, you can guess which one it's free.

The certification consists 4-Day 40-Hour Training program on the **V2.0** that it won't make you an expert but will help you to get you started making tailored solutions and facilitate the workshops.

And yes, you have to "**pay-to-learn**", there is no other way around it, specially because it's teached to others, a summary and mind map won't be helpfull at all.

There’s no way around it, especially because the methodology is meant to be taught through experience. A summary or mind map won’t be helpful at all. To truly grasp it, you need to learn from a well-structured example of how sessions are guided, reinforced by studying and analyzing what was done.

<br>

## Wait, Wasn’t It Open Source?

Yes, it’s expensive. And honestly? I’ve already spent ten times that amount on LEGO, so why not go the extra mile and get a certification?

But back to the main topic, as with everything Open Source, there’s a ~~pay-to-win~~ “**Pro**” version with modifications that make it worth it.

Sure, you can dive into the instructions for the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Starter Kit (15 minutes) or explore the [Open Source Guide](https://davidgauntlett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LEGO_SERIOUS_PLAY_OpenSource_14mb.pdf) (40 minutes at worst). It’s a solid starting point, but it won’t answer the really important questions, like:

- How do I gain both practical experience and theoretical knowledge?
- How do I lead a session?
- How do I manage participants?
- What should my behavior be during a session?
- What happens if X does Y, and Z isn’t happy about it?
- How do we manage time~~ and space~~?
- Where can I find predefined exercises with detailed steps?
- Can I get custom materials?

These are the gaps that Version 2.0, along with the training, aims to bridge. It’s not just about having a framework—it’s about learning the techniques and striving to master them.

## Where Can I Get It?

For North and Central America you can contact them directly, but for South America you will have to get to them through official Partners.

- México: AD HOC.
- Chile: [Meraki Consultores](https://merakiconsultores.cl/lego-seriousplay/).

<br>

## What About The Course That Last Two Days?

There are multiple sites that offer the certification in two or three days... beware of those! 4 is about right for the training and you will require to practice on your own, so if you get a offer that will give you that amount of training in less than that, don't expect much!

Specially when the [Master Trainers in LEGO SERIOUS PLAY method](https://www.youtube.com/@mastertrainerslegoseriousplay) has a [video](https://youtu.be/ZdFSaJqf_Tk?si=59amQUPG9IjDNygk) explaining why it takes that amount of time.

Don't fall for those!

<br>

## Do I Get The Same?

Knock yourself out, but keep in mind that your trainer will make the difference in your journey! And having someone with good reputation will help you.
