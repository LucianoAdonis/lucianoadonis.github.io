# What it is the LSP?

When you search for the meaning and description of LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® (LSP), you’ll come across multiple interpretations—and that’s the beauty of the methodology, it opens up numerous opportunities for deep learning and innovative thinking. With the right guidance, it can also unlock the potential of the people you work with.

LSP originated in 2001, created by the LEGO® Group to keep up with the growing demand for innovative problem-solving and team-building approaches. However, since 2010, the LEGO® Group no longer supports the methodology (LSP V1.0). However, the *Association of Master Trainers* in the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Method has stepped in to keep it up-to-date, continuously refining and evolving the model.

LSP is a powerful approach with a wide range of applications, fostering deep learning and innovative thinking. Moreover, there's an [LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Certification](https://seriousplay.community/usa/certification/) for those who want to master the methodology in the version 2.0.


As quoted from the certification site, LSP enables individuals and teams to:

- Unlock the potential of people and their values.
- Develop teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal relationships.
- Create and validate business models.
- Facilitate strategic planning meetings.
- Define and refine mission, vision, and organizational values.
- Design innovative products or services.
- Analyze scenarios and explore actionable solutions.


# Why it does it have a certification?

Well, as mentioned before there is a version 1.0 and 2.0, you can guess which one it's free. So the certification consists 4-Day 40-Hour Training program that it won't make you an expert but will help you to facilitate the workshops and have the tools to work with them.

## Why Paying for it? It's Open Source

Yes it is quite expensive, and in my honest opinion I've already have expended 10 times that in LEGO, so I may as well get a certification. But going back to the main topic as everything Open Source, there is a **pay-to-win** "Pro" version with modifications that makes it worth it.

I mean, go ahead read and read the instruction of the LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® Starter Kit (15 min) or the [Open Source](https://davidgauntlett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LEGO_SERIOUS_PLAY_OpenSource_14mb.pdf) content (40 min).

It will give you a base, but not answers to:

- How do I lead a session?
- How do I manage participants?
- What should be my behavior?
- What happens if X does Y and Z doesn't like it?
- How do we control time **and space**? 
- Where can I get predefined excersices with detailed steps?
- Do
- Practice and Theorical knowledge.

## Where do I get it?

For North and Central America you can contact them directly, but for South America you will have to get to them through official Partners like [Meraki Consultores](https://merakiconsultores.cl/lego-seriousplay/).

By quoting the site again:

- Design and facilitate custom workshops
- Apply the methods to teams and organizations
- Create an engaging and productive experience for clients
