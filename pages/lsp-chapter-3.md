How and where use each kit and the amount it's part of the training, but keep in mind it will be expensive.

## Shipping

If you live in the [best and first country of Chile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61hqRtsIXDM&ab_channel=Tetuaje), congrats! But be warned, it’s going to be expensive.

Also, remind that you will need a **valid email address** to buy the SERIOUS PLAY kits. And valid means that you are part of the Trainers Association.

To get the products from the [LEGO Store](https://www.lego.com/es-us), you’ll need to use one of the following methods:

- **Direct Shipping**: Generally, this option is not great.
  - I haven’t tried it myself, but shipments from other countries to Chile can take a long time—expect at least a month.
  - While Chile is selectable as a destination, the site doesn’t allow you to add your full postal code. And during the calculation screen enforces the same range of numbers that USA uses.
- **Casilla Correos (P.O. Box Service)**: expensive but does the job.
- **Amazon JP**: it only has the Starter Kits, but you can get it for a good price and with less paperwork.


## Casilla Internacional (P.O. Box Service)

There is a lot to cover, but to keep it simple, here is the summary:

  - **Registration is Free**: You don’t need to pay to get an ID, which you’ll use as your address on the LEGO site. The service is based in Miami, so shipping to the P.O. Box is usually cheap or even free. Of course you will pay them the shipment to Chile, so keep that in mind!
  - **Flat Rate Shipping**: Once your package is in Miami, mentalize yourself to pay at least 30 USD (based on my experience) to have it forwarded to Chile. However, for larger packages like SERIOUS PLAY kits, the cost increases significantly. Add taxes, and it’s going to get pricey.
  - **Reliability**: The good part? Your package will almost certainly arrive, and you can follow up directly with the service if something goes wrong.
  - **Timing**: After your package arrives in Miami and you pay the import costs, it typically takes 3–4 weeks to get to you.
    - Note: Shipments are usually sent out on Thursdays. So if you pay on a Friday, expect a week’s delay before it even leaves Miami.

### Buy Process


- Add your address to the LEGO Store as your main address. When logged into the Casilla site, you can see it [here](https://casillainternacional.com/CLAyuda.aspx)
- Once you have buy it, make the prealert, and add the purchase information [here](https://casillainternacional.com/PBOXCASILLA/ifprealerta_nous.aspx).
  - This will make the paperwork more faster.
- If you are worried about the amount to buy, the site has a [Price Calculator](https://casillainternacional.com/tarifas_calculadora.aspx) to simulate how much you will have to pay. Brace yourself.
- Wait until you receive the notification that the package has arrived to the facility, and pay!
- The shipment should happen soon enough and your package will arrive... eventually.

# Alternatives to the Kits

You can surely use used LEGO, outside of my collection I have over 90 pounds of it. **But** it probably won't be enough, here are the reasons:

- **Damage**:
- **Consistency**: some pieces that one would consider to be common aren't at all.
  - A window glass and a firetruck stair, are odd. Taking into a account all of the LEGO that I own including the displayed sets, I only have 7 at best. Same goes for other pieces like windshields. 
- **Special Pieces**:
  - The connections kit its a gold mine. The possibiliies, the lack of limitations! I swear it's amazing just for existing.

And what about the unbranded Kits? Well, it depends:

- **Aliexpress**:
  - I've already build a few sets, and I can assure you that your fingertips will burn a little. I saw the comment in a reddit post and it was actually true, it has to do with the paint.
  - Some fade after cleaning them.
  - Quality it's not the same, it's painful to admit, but a LEGO will last a lot and it won't suffer from external conditions like climate as much as an alternative brick.

- **IKEA**:
  - Unless you don't have the Window Explotarion Bag and because of shipping it's not good for you, that could be an option.
  - Not enough pieces and variety. Same as used, some pieces are rare even for common sets.
