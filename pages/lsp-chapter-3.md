# LEGO Kits

As mentioned before, they provide existent kits containing the pieces needed to make the sessions, here is the summary:

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-window-exploration-bag.png">Window Exploration Bag</span>** [(#2000409)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/window-exploration-bag-2000409): for short activities.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-starter-kit.png">Starter Kit</span>** [(#2000414)](https://www.lego.com/es-us/product/starter-kit-2000414): Begin to get serious.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-identity-and-landscape-kit.png">Identity and Landscape Kit</span>** [(#2000430)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/identity-and-landscape-kit-2000430): Live Serious
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-connections-kit.png">Connections Kit</span>** [(#2000431)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/connections-kit-2000431): Live fast and serious.

How and where use each kit and the amount it's part of the training, but keep in mind it will be expensive.

## Shipping

If you live in the [best and first country of Chile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61hqRtsIXDM&ab_channel=Tetuaje), congrats! But be warned, it’s going to be expensive.

Also, remind that you will need a **valid email address** to buy the SERIOUS PLAY kits. And valid means that you are part of the Trainers Association.

To get the products from the [LEGO Store](https://www.lego.com/es-us), you’ll need to use one of the following methods:

- **Direct Shipping**: Generally, this option is not great.
  - I haven’t tried it myself, but shipments from other countries to Chile can take a long time—expect at least a month.
  - While Chile is selectable as a destination, the site doesn’t allow you to add your full postal code. And during the calculation screen enforces the same range of numbers that USA uses.
- **Casilla Correos (P.O. Box Service)**:
  - **Registration is Free**: You don’t need to pay to get an ID, which you’ll use as your address on the LEGO site. The service is based in Miami, so shipping to the P.O. Box is usually cheap or even free.
  - **Flat Rate Shipping**: Once your package is in Miami, you’ll pay a flat rate of 30 USD (based on my experience) to have it forwarded to Chile. However, for larger packages like SERIOUS PLAY kits, the cost increases significantly. Add taxes, and it’s going to get pricey.
  - **Reliability**: The good part? Your package will almost certainly arrive, and you can follow up directly with the service if something goes wrong.
  - **Timing**: After your package arrives in Miami and you pay the import costs, it typically takes 3–4 weeks to get to you.
    - Note: Shipments are usually sent out on Thursdays. So if you pay on a Friday, expect a week’s delay before it even leaves Miami.
- **Amazon JP**: EVENTUALLY.

# Alternatives to the Kits

You can surely use used LEGO, outside of my collection I have over 90 pounds of it. **But** it probably won't be enough, here are the reasons:

- **Damage**:
- **Consistency**: some pieces that one would consider to be common aren't at all.
  - A window glass and a firetruck stair, are odd. Taking into a account all of the LEGO that I own including the displayed sets, I only have 7 at best. Same goes for other pieces like windshields. 
- **Special Pieces**:
  - The connections kit its a gold mine. The possibiliies, the lack of limitations! I swear it's amazing just for existing.

And what about the unbranded Kits? Well, it depends:

- **Aliexpress**:
  - I've already build a few sets, and I can assure you that your fingertips will burn a little. I saw the comment in a reddit post and it was actually true, it has to do with the paint.
  - Some fade after cleaning them.
  - Quality it's not the same, it's painful to admit, but a LEGO will last a lot and it won't suffer from external conditions like climate as much as an alternative brick.

- **IKEA**:
  - Unless you don't have the Window Explotarion Bag and because of shipping it's not good for you, that could be an option.
  - Not enough pieces and variety. Same as used, some pieces are rare even for common sets.
