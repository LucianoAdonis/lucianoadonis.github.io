# LEGO Kits

As mentioned before, they provide existent kits containing the pieces needed to make the sessions, here is the summary:

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-window-exploration-bag.png">Window Exploration Bag</span>** [(#2000409)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/window-exploration-bag-2000409): for short activities.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-starter-kit.png">Starter Kit</span>** [(#2000414)](https://www.lego.com/es-us/product/starter-kit-2000414): Begin to get serious.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-identity-and-landscape-kit.png">Identity and Landscape Kit</span>** [(#2000430)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/identity-and-landscape-kit-2000430): Live Serious
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/lsp/product-connections-kit.png">Connections Kit</span>** [(#2000431)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/connections-kit-2000431): Live fast and serious.

# Alternatives to the Kits

You can surely use used LEGO, outside of my collection I have over 90 pounds of it. **But** it probably won't be enough, here are the reasons:

- **Damage**:
- **Consistency**: some pieces that one would consider to be common aren't at all.
  - A window glass and a firetruck stair, are odd. Taking into a account all of the LEGO that I own including the displayed sets, I only have 7 at best. Same goes for other pieces like windshields. 
- **Special Pieces**:
  - The connections kit its a gold mine. The possibiliies, the lack of limitations! I swear it's amazing just for existing.

And what about the unbranded Kits? Well, it depends:

- **Aliexpress**:
  - I've already build a few sets, and I can assure you that your fingertips will burn a little. I saw the comment in a reddit post and it was actually true, it has to do with the paint.
  - Some fade after cleaning them.
  - Quality it's not the same, it's painful to admit, but a LEGO will last a lot and it won't suffer from external conditions like climate as much as an alternative brick.

- **IKEA**:
  - Unless you don't have the Window Explotarion Bag and because of shipping it's not good for you, that could be an option.
  - Not enough pieces and variety. Same as used, some pieces are rare even for common sets.
