# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

Turning team activity into readable metrics sounds simple until you try to do it across multiple projects, squads, and people who all use Jira slightly differently. This guide came out of a real attempt to build something that could track engineer distribution, workload, and progress without requiring someone to manually compile spreadsheets every week.

A good tracking system shows you where effort is going. The transparency cuts both ways: yes, it tells management where people are, and it also gives you the data to push back when the workload is unreasonable.
