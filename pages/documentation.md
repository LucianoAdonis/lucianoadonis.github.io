### What to Look for

We tend to miss a lot of information when we write because we skip the obvious stuff to keep things simple, which isn’t necessarily bad.

Here are some tips:

- Avoid using subtitles for everything—sometimes less is more.
- Think about your approach when writing. Personally, I like to brain-dump everything and then organize it later. Sometimes, I even start with the conclusion. But others might prefer to outline their titles first and work from there.
- When writing, think about the person who’ll be reading this. What will their first thought be? It’s a good practice to assume they’ll have more knowledge gaps than you do, so cover those quickly and clearly.
