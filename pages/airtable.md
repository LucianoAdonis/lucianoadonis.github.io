# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

Is the new Manager Meta using AirTable?

Well, kinda it is, it's cool and it has a lot of new features that lets your data appear organized and even more professional.

Probably that's the reason why I heard a lot in the past year (at the moment of writing this) that all things must be imported to Airtable.

Still finding the meaning behind those words...

But as now, I can tell you that one of it's biggest features are the <span class="highlight">Interfaces</span> which to put it simple, it's the front end for your data. If you start from scratch, it may see simple, but if you select an example you will see that it has potential to become an inventory tool with submenus and all!

And this is the story of how Micromonagement v2 started.

## How to Use This Mini-Book

First, I recommend avoiding reading this on mobile for the best experience. Second, this mini-book is **focused on the free tier of Airtable**, but I'll add the missing parts that use a higher tier just for the full display.

In regards to the exposition of the content:

- **Highlighted Words**: I'll use a Tomato color to highlight key concepts or macros so you won't see hyperlinks everywhere.
- **Image Examples**:
  - I like this format, but it might miss some details between clicks.
  - You can click on images to view them in full.
- **Expandable Code**: If you see an option to expand the code, it's an example—feel free to skip it if you don't need the details.

# Chapters Overview

The content will be split into four sections, as the index bar exceeded its length, making it easier to read and navigate:

- [Chapter 1: Basics](/pages/airtable-chapter-1): Start here if you feel awkward navigating airtable.
- [Chapter 1.5: Advanced Basics](/pages/airtable-chapter-1-5): Bridging the gap between basics and data management.
- [Chapter 2: Data & Base](/pages/airtable-chapter-2): How to format your pages.
- [Chapter 3: Formulas and Integrations](/pages/airtable-chapter-3): Macros
- [Chapter 3.5: Advanced Scripting](/pages/airtable-chapter-3-5): Taking your formulas to the next level.
- [Chapter 4: Interface Improvements](/pages/airtable-chapter-4): Random trivia that might be useful on a date to break the ice.
