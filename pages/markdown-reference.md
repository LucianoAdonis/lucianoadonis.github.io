## Expandable Blocks

Markdown itself does not natively support expandable or collapsible sections. However, you can use HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags to create expandable sections in environments that support HTML within Markdown (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Note that not all Markdown renderers support this.

**Example:**

```markdown
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  <p>This is the content that will be hidden until clicked.</p>
</details>
