# What Are My OKRs?
Depending on your methodology—like the Spotify Model—you might see a hierarchy:

- Business
  - Development
    - Infrastructure

Your specific OKRs in Infrastructure may be influenced by overarching business objectives and directly tied to the deliverables of development teams.

## OKR Highlight Types

Not all tasks directly tie to an OKR's stated goals but are nonetheless valuable. To account for this in reports, consider categorizing tasks as follows:

- Business: Essential changes for team or organizational goals.
- Express: Urgent priorities requiring immediate action.
- Innovation: Creative solutions that enhance quality of life.
- Enhancements: Refinements to boost process efficiency.
- Standardization: Efforts to unify practices across teams.
- Adjustments: Necessary updates for team functionality.

This categorization helps highlight the indirect value contributed by support teams like infrastructure.
