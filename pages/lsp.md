# Why This Mini-Book?

Unless you’ve attended an **LSP Certification Training**, it’s hard to grasp what it truly offers. And even when you do, explaining the experience can be a bit challeng¡ng.

Attending an **LSP training** is a different experience altogether. It provides the applied version of the methodology—crafted from extensive considerations, techniques, studies, and practice. Most importantly, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a structured or tailored version designed specifically for your team or company.

That’s why I’ll try to summarize it in a way that captures its essence without breaking any legal agreements.

# Chapters Overview

The content will be split into four sections, as the index bar exceeded its length, making it easier to read and navigate:

- [Chapter 0: What Led Me Here (Optional)](/pages/lsp-chapter-0): Rant about my existence.
- [Chapter 1: Many Questions](/pages/lsp-chapter-1): You will have a lot of questions if you are wondering about attending or not.
- [Chapter 2: Explain It](/pages/lsp-chapter-2): "Boom", "kaboom" & "tuturu".
- [Chapter 3: Materials](/pages/lsp-chapter-3): Bricks dahhh.
