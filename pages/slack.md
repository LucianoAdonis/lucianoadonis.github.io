# Organization

## Workspace
Slack allows you to organize your chats and channels by grouping them under sections, providing a clear visual representation of the source of conversations. 

What do you gain from this extra step? If you work with many team a hundreds of people, you can assign them to a specific section, so whenever you go back to a conversation or get a message you already know the main association for them.

This is specially useful if there are many teams involved. Not getting crazy while doing our work in tech should be a priority.

## Emojis

You can also personalize sections with Emojis. I tend to assign emojis that match the team or purpose. e.g. WiFi for Networking teams, Shield for security etc.

I like the example of a coworker that uses pokemons to identify each group.

## Theme

Style above else, it doesn't have bright colors I don't want to use it.


## Slack User Groups
Creating a Slack User Group for your team or a group can significantly simplify managing communications. By having a user group, you can:
- Add users to multiple channels. By setting the default channels for the group itself, new members added to it will be included to all the channels.
- Avoid the need to tag all team members individually when asking questions or making announcements. Less dependency on one team member and less awkwarness when reaching out to a team and tagging each person.


# Channels

### Suggested Channel Organization
If you don’t have a list of channels (refer to the Team Context section), consider adding them progressively in the following order:
1. **Infrastructure Channels and Internal Groups:** These could include channels related to core systems, internal discussions, and technical operations.
2. **Squad Channels:** Channels dedicated to your squad's activities, such as Scrum meetings, DevOps tasks, and notifications.
3. **External Teams:** Include channels for communication with external teams or services, like MyID, Datadog, O11Y, Bespin, or any other necessary integrations.

## Pin Important Messages
Use the pin feature to keep crucial messages at the top of a channel for easy access. This is particularly useful for quick reference to documents, key decisions, or ongoing discussions.

## Set Channel Purposes and Topics
Clearly define the purpose and topic of each channel. This helps new members quickly understand the channel's focus and reduces off-topic discussions.

## Use Threads to Keep Discussions Organized
Encourage the use of threads to keep conversations within a channel organized. Threads help in maintaining clarity by containing specific discussions within a single message, preventing the main channel from becoming cluttered.

## Mute Channels to Reduce Noise
If you’re part of channels that aren’t immediately relevant but still need to be monitored, consider muting them. This way, you won’t receive notifications, but you can still check in when necessary.


## Use the “Do Not Disturb” Mode
Enable “Do Not Disturb” mode during focused work sessions to silence notifications. You can also schedule “Do Not Disturb” hours to ensure uninterrupted time during and outside of work hours.
