# Organization

## Workspace
Slack allows you to organize your chats and channels by grouping them under sections, providing a clear visual representation of the source of conversations. 

What do you gain from this extra step? If you work with many team a hundreds of people, you can assign them to a specific section, so whenever you go back to a conversation or get a message you already know the main association for them.

This is specially useful if there are many teams involved. Not getting crazy while doing our work in tech should be a priority.

## Emojis

You can also personalize sections with Emojis. I tend to assign emojis that match the team or purpose. e.g. WiFi for Networking teams, Shield for security etc.

I like the example of a coworker that uses pokemons to identify each group.

## Visual Organization

### Emoji Strategy
Use consistent emoji prefixes for quick visual identification:
- üî¥ Critical/Production
- üü° Development/Staging
- üü¢ General/Information
- üîß Technical
- üéØ Projects
- üì¢ Announcements

### Custom Themes

Theme recommendations:
- Dark mode: #1A1D21,#232529,#2F3136,#FFFFFF
- Light mode: #FFFFFF,#F8F8F8,#2F3136,#1A1D21
- Accessible: High contrast themes for better readability

Style above else, it doesn't have bright colors I don't want to use it.


## Slack User Groups
Creating a Slack User Group for your team or a group can significantly simplify managing communications. By having a user group, you can:
- Add users to multiple channels. By setting the default channels for the group itself, new members added to it will be included to all the channels.
- Avoid the need to tag all team members individually when asking questions or making announcements. Less dependency on one team member and less awkwarness when reaching out to a team and tagging each person.


## Channels

### Essential Channels Setup
