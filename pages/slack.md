# Style

You will spend a lot of time here, so it is best for you to get comfortable.

## Emoji Side Bars

You can also personalize sections with Emojis. I tend to assign emojis that match the team or purpose. e.g. WiFi for Networking teams, Shield for security etc.

I like the example of a coworker that uses pokemons to identify each group.

If you don't have multiple types of emojis, you can do a lot with the default ones:
- üî¥ Critical/Production
- üü° Development/Staging
- üü¢ General/Information
- üîß Technical
- üéØ Projects
- üì¢ Announcements

And then proceed to mute all the channels that doesn't add value to your work.

## Custom Themes

This is more like a preference thing, but you can try the following examples:

- **Mickey Mode**: `#1E328F,#091861,#20A271,#7C7A7F`
- **Dark Mode**: `#1A1D21,#232529,#2F3136,#FFFFFF`
- **Light Mode**: `#FFFFFF,#F8F8F8,#2F3136,#1A1D21`

This can be configured from the Preferences Menu, under Appearance, select the "Custom" tab that it is at the right side of "Slack Themes".

## More Tips

* **Pinned Items Structure**
   üìå Pinned Content:
   1. Team agreements
   2. On-call schedule
   3. Important links
   4. Emergency procedures
   5. Team documentation

* **Thread Best Practices:**
   - Technical discussions
   - Problem-solving
   - Multiple responses
   - Status updates

* **Custom Statuses:**
   - ü•ô Lunch: use a healthy food as the emoji so people believe that you are a healthy person.
   - üóìÔ∏è In meeting: this can be set automatically for you if you add the proper integration like with Outlook.
   - üî¥ Do not disturb
   - ‚è∞ Be right back (or BRB).
   - üìâ Internet Issues: there will be probably a better emoji for it, but it will help to show others if you suddenly appear disconnected at times randomly.

# Optimization

It's fun to do things until you do them over 20 times.

## Slack User Groups

By having a user group, you can:
- Add users to multiple channels. By setting the default channels for the group itself, new members added to it will be included to all the channels.
- Avoid the need to tag all team members individually when asking questions or making announcements.
   - Less dependency on one team member and less awkwarness when reaching out to a team and tagging each person.


* **Group Structure:**
   - @team-all: Everyone in the team
   - @team-dev: Developers
   - @team-ops: Operations
   - @team-leads: Team leads
   - @team-oncall: Current on-call

## Workspace
Slack allows you to organize your chats and channels by grouping them under sections, providing a clear visual representation of the source of conversations. 

What do you gain from this extra step? If you work with many team a hundreds of people, you can assign them to a specific section, so whenever you go back to a conversation or get a message you already know the main association for them.

This is specially useful if there are many teams involved. Not getting crazy while doing our work in tech should be a priority.

## Channels

### Essential Channels Setup

Normally this will be determine for your organization but if you are starting from scratch, maybe the following structure could help you:

1. **Team Operations**
   - `#team-standups`: Daily meetings
   - `#team-announcements`: Important updates
   - `#team-social`: Non-work discussions

2. **Technical Channels**
   - `#tech-architecture`: Design discussions
   - `#tech-reviews`: Code reviews
   - `#tech-deployments`: Release coordination

3. **Support Channels**
