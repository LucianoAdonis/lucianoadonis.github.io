> Insert some Sonic reference here

Sometimes the difference in some aspects of life will be noticeable and you will have to adjust to the rythm that they move to.

From my personal experience is more like "Oh, I was like that at X years old".




## Leadership

Oh it depends on how you to look at it, for some may be saying the right thing while for other may be doing the right thing. You won't make everyone happy so you may as well be happy and proud of yourself.
