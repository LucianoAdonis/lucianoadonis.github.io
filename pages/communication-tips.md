# How This Mini-Book Can Help You

Whether you are onboarding onto a new team or just looking to sharpen your day-to-day messaging, this book gathers the communication patterns that tend to make the biggest difference in technical workplaces.

The first two chapters cover the platforms where most conversations happen: Slack and Microsoft Teams. The remaining chapters are platform-agnostic: everyday tech vocabulary, ready-to-use message templates, and a structured approach to incident response communication.

Pick the chapter that matches what you need right now, or read them in order for a full overview.
