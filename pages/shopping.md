# Products

The products on this list are ones that I've truly put to the test and found invaluable.

<br>  

## Organization

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/label-maker.png">Label Maker (Brother P-Touch PTH110)</span>**: Perfect for categorizing and keeping things in order.
  - Letters and symbols can be personalized with borders.
  - Variety of colors.
  - Can do wonders for organizing plastic and crystal Food Storage Containers.
  - Some tapes can be added to clothes.
  - Note: There is a slight tape waste between prints; it is more of a product issue than a configuration problem.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/plastic-box-wenco.png">Transparent Boxes (Wenco)</span>**: I prefer clear boxes because they allow me to see what's inside.
  - Even with transparent boxes, labels are a game-changer when stacked or stored at angles.

## Cleaning & Lifestyle

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/instant-vortex-mini-air-fryer.png">Air Fryer (Instant Vortex Mini)</span>**: can revive bread and make it feel fresh. What else do you want?
  - It's also incredible to fry other foods.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/eufy-cordless-vacuum-s11.png">Cordless Vacuum (Eufy S11)</span>**: I'm not too fond of cords, this vacuum frees you from them.
  - Cleaning the dirt from the container is straightforward.
  - Double filters.
  - There may be other models, but this is more than enough for my needs.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/eufy-twin-turbo-x8.png">Robot Vacuum (Eufy Twin Turbo X8)</span>**: there are multiple options and most of the time it comes down to what you need. 
  - If you have a pet you will need a bigger dust container, and you don't get that under 200 USD.
  - In some reviews laser is considered dumb. But that applies for small spaces, in big open spaces it helps a lot.
  - If the above it is your case, then the displayed model is a good match.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/eufy-scale.png">Scale (Eufy Smart Scale)</span>**: A convenient tool to get detailed metrics about your body.
  - It provides reports on body fat, muscle mass, water percentage, and other key health indicators to help you track your progress.

## Work Tech

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/apple-trackpad.png">Mouse (Apple Magic Trackpad)</span>**: For an authentic gaming 
experience and the satisfaction of drawing on a shared 
screen.
  - Large surface area for comfortable use and multi-touch gestures.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/airpods-pro-second-generation.png">In-ear Headphones (AirPods Pro 2nd Gen)</span>**: "I don't like cords. They're coarse, rough, irritating, and they get everywhere."
  - I love the transparency feature and being able to listen to music without being uncomfortable.

  - Perfect for side-by-side document viewing or coding.
  - Reduces the need for multiple monitors, saving desk space.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/laser-printer.png">Laser Printer (Brother)</span>**:  The best choice if you're tired of unreliable printers.
  - Unlike inkjet printers that use liquid ink, laser printers use toner, a fine powder that is bonded to the paper through heat and magnetism.
    - This method makes the print more durable and avoids issues like dried-out cartridges.
  - You can print thousands of pages with one toner refill.
  - It doesn't print in color, but unless you need to print your kids' homework, you won’t miss it.
  - Reliable and efficient.
  - My model has an additional paper storage container. It’s essentially an extension to hold extra pages, which keeps them dust-free.
    - It’s also easy to remove—just a simple cover for the papers that stick out from the printer.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/magnetic-cables.png">Magnetic Charging Cables (Ankndo)</span>**: These are essentially magnetic cables with interchangeable tips for different connectors to leave the adapter in your devices.
  - A great way to standardize charging for multiple devices that use Micro USB, USB-C, and Lightning, _one cable to rule them all_.
  - It comes with multiple cable lengths and several tip types for each main phone cable. You can also purchase additional heads separately.
  - Especially handy for anyone who prefers not to fiddle with different cables, making it perfect for older or less tech-savvy users.

## Aliexpress

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/aliexpress-foam-machine.png">Foam Washing Machine</span>**: I can't recommend this enough.

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/aliexpress-extendable-arm.png">Extendable Arm</span>**: A versatile and adjustable arm for mounting devices or accessories.

## House Tools

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/makita-cordless-screwdriver.png">Cordless Screwdriver (Makita)</span>**: It’s like a first aid kit, but for furniture and anything else with screws.

## Tried and Regretted

- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/elgato-streamdeck-mk2.png">Elgato Stream Deck MK.2</span>**: It's a cool gadget, but honestly, it's not that useful for me unless you're into gaming or streaming. It can help a lot, but it's often more effective to simplify your workflow rather than set up automation for everything.
  - You can customize the buttons with different themes and assign them to tasks like running automation, launching apps, or even closing programs.
- **<span class="hover-image-trigger" data-image="../images/shopping/lifesmart-cololight-strip.png">LifeSmart ColoLight, 60 Leds</span>**: it's a good product if you like lights and bright colors, but it isn't for me.
  - It's extensible and doesn't require welding to do expand it as it has defined connectors.
  - Price is awful but understandable.

# Useful Sites

- [RTINGS](https://www.rtings.com/): A great site for comparing products. Unfortunately, I discovered it after buying a headset that was a complete disappointment, so I can attest that their reviews are spot-on.
