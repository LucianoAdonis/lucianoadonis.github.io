# Products

The products on this list are ones that I've truly put to the test and found invaluable.

## Organization

- **Label Maker (Brother P-Touch PTH110)**: Perfect for categorizing and keeping things in order.
  - Letters and symbols can be personalized with borders.
  - Variety of colors.
  - Can do wonders for organizing plastic and crystal Food Storage Containers.
  - Some tapes can be added to clothes.
  - Note: There is a slight tape waste between prints; it is more of a product issue than a configuration problem.

- **Transparent Boxes (Wenco)**: I prefer clear boxes because they allow me to see what's inside.
  - Even with transparent boxes, labels are a game-changer when stacked or stored at angles.

## Cleaning & Lifestyle

- **Air Fryer**: can revive bread and make it feel fresh. What else do you want?
  - It's also incredible to fry other foods.
- **Vertical Vacuum (Eufy)**: I'm not too fond of cords, this vacuum frees you from them.
  - Cleaning the dirt from the container is straightforward.
  - Double filters.
  - There may be other models, but this is more than enough for my needs.
- **Robot Vacuum (Eufy Twin Turbo)**: there are multiple options and most of the time it comes down to what you need. 
  - If you have a pet you will need a bigger dust container, and you don't get that under 200 USD.
  - In some reviews laser is considered dumb. But that applies for small spaces, in big open spaces it helps a lot.
  - If the above it is your case, then the displayed model is a good match.
- **Scale (Eufy Smart Scale)**: A convenient tool to get detailed metrics about your body.
  - It provides reports on body fat, muscle mass, water percentage, and other key health indicators to help you track your progress.
  - Syncs with your phone via the Eufy Health App for easy tracking. Some models also offer WiFi syncing for added convenience.
  - This also allows you to track your history and progress over time.
- **Ereader (Kindle)**: If I'm honest, I prefer real books, but the Kindle is easy on the eyes and offers a ton of convenience.
  - The book you're reading shows up as the Kindle's cover.
    - For users in Latin America, you may need to contact support to enable this feature, or pay a small fee to remove ads and display book covers instead.
  - The battery lasts a long time, so you don’t have to worry about frequent charging.
  - You can also upload other documents and convert them to Kindle-friendly formats like EPUB.

## Work Tech

- **Mouse (Apple Trackpad)**: For an authentic gaming experience and the satisfaction of drawing on a shared screen.
- **In-ear Headphones (AirPods Pro)**: "I don't like cords. They're coarse, rough, irritating, and they get everywhere."
  - I love the transparency feature and being able to listen to music without being uncomfortable.
- **Curved Monitor (Samsung Curved 34")**: You won't be able to work at the same level with one screen.
- **Laser Printer (HP NeverStop)**: The best choice if you're tired of unreliable printers.
  - Unlike inkjet printers that use liquid ink, laser printers use toner, a fine powder that is bonded to the paper through heat and magnetism.
    - This method makes the print more durable and avoids issues like dried-out cartridges.
  - You can print thousands of pages with one toner refill.
  - It doesn't print in color, but unless you need to print your kids' homework, you won’t miss it.
  - Reliable and efficient.
  - My model has an additional paper storage container. It’s essentially an extension to hold extra pages, which keeps them dust-free.
    - It’s also easy to remove—just a simple cover for the papers that stick out from the printer.
- **Magnetic Charging Cables (Ankndo)**: These are essentially magnetic cables with interchangeable tips for different connectors to leave the adapter in your devices.
  - A great way to standardize charging for multiple devices that use Micro USB, USB-C, and Lightning, _one cable to rule them all_.
  - It comes with multiple cable lengths and several tip types for each main phone cable. You can also purchase additional heads separately.
  - Especially handy for anyone who prefers not to fiddle with different cables, making it perfect for older or less tech-savvy users.


## Aliexpress

- **Foam Washing Machine**: I can't recommend this enough.
  - I tried soap dispensers, but they were a hassle. The foam dispenser, however, works perfectly.

- **Solar Lights**: Exceeded my expectations, and work better than I imagined.
- **Rechargeable Lights for Hallways and Other Spaces**: No more bumping into furniture in the dark.
  - When paired with the **Magnetic Charging Cables (Ankndo)**, it makes life even easier.
- **Extendable Arm**: A handy tool for picking up items, with soft silicone tips for better grip.
  - It also has a small magnet, making it easy to retrieve small metal objects.
  - Not just useful for seniors—everyone can benefit from it!
- **Fluorescent Tape**: Bright and practical.
- **Coin Cutter**: Convenient for cutting perfect circles from coins or other small, round items.

## Tried and Regreted

- **Elgato Streamdeck**: It’s a cool gadget, but honestly, it's not that useful for me unless you’re into gaming or streaming. It can help a lot, but it’s often more effective to simplify your workflow rather than set up automation for everything.
  - You can customize the buttons with different themes and assign them to tasks like running automation, launching apps, or even closing programs.

# Useful Sites

- [RTINGS](https://www.rtings.com/): A great site for comparing products. Unfortunately, I discovered it after buying a headset that was a complete disappointment, so I can attest that their reviews are spot-on.
