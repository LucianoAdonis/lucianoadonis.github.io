# Products

The products on this list are ones that I've truly put to the test and found invaluable.

## Organization

- **Label Maker (Brother P-Touch PTH110)**: Perfect for categorizing and keeping things in order.
  - Letters and symbols can be personalized with borders.
  - Variety of colors.
  - Can do wonders for organizing plastic and crystal Food Storage Containers.
  - Some tapes can be added to clothes.
  - Note: There is a slight tape waste between prints; it is more of a product issue than a configuration problem.

- **Transparent Boxes (Wenco)**: I prefer clear boxes because they allow me to see what's inside.
  - Even with transparent boxes, labels are a game-changer when stacked or stored at angles.

## Cleaning & Lifestyle

- **Air Fryer**: can revive bread and make it feel fresh. What else do you want?
  - It's also incredible to fry other foods.
- **Vertical Vacuum (Eufy)**: I'm not too fond of cords, this vacuum frees you from them.
  - Cleaning the dirt from the container is straightforward.
  - Double filters.
  - There may be other models, but this is more than enough for my needs.
- **Robot Vacuum (Eufy Twin Turbo)**: there are multiple options and most of the time it comes down to what you need. 
  - If you have a pet you will need a bigger dust container, and you don't get that under 200 USD.
  - In some reviews laser is considered dumb. But that applies for small spaces, in big open spaces it helps a lot.
  - If the above it is your case, then the displayed model is a good match.
- **Scale (Eufy)**: A sleek way to get detailed metrics about your body.

## Work Tech

- **Mouse (Apple Trackpad)**: For an authentic gaming experience and the satisfaction of drawing on a shared screen.
- **In-ear Headphones (AirPods Pro)**: "I don't like cords. They're coarse, rough, irritating, and they get everywhere."
  - I love the transparency feature and being able to listen to music without being uncomfortable.
- **Curved Monitor (Samsung Curved 34")**: You won't be able to work at the same level with one screen.
- **Laser Printer (HP NeverStop)**: best purchase if you don't trust your printer.
  - Laser uses a dust that magnetise to the paper which makes it durable and doesn't have the problem of getting dry.
  - Thousand of pages per catridge.
  - You won't have colors, but unless you have to do some homework for your kids, it won't be a problem.
  - Trustable.
  - The model that I use, has a storage container, but it is just an extension which allows to leave pages there without worrying about the dust. 
    - Also easy to remove, it is just a cover for the part that gets outside of the printer.

## Aliexpress

- **Soap Dispenser**
- **Solar lights**
- **Rechargable Lights for hallways and other spaces**: no more bumpying in the night.
- **Extendable Arm**
- **Fluorescent Tape**
- **Coin Cutter**

## Tried and Regreted

- Elgato Streamdeck.

# Useful Sites

- [RTINGS](https://www.rtings.com/): A great site for comparing products. Unfortunately, I discovered it after buying a headset that was a complete disappointment, so I can attest that their reviews are spot-on.
