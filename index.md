At work, I get to connect with all kinds of interesting people and dive into a variety of ideas. But with so much ground to cover, things can get a bit chaotic, and keeping everyone in the loop can be a challenge. That's where the 'Mini Books' on this site come in â€“ they're designed to create a shared understanding and make things smoother down the line! ðŸš€

### Optimization
Time is money, and more time we have, we can waste it in other things, like hobbies and family!

- [Buy it for Life](./pages/shopping.md): recommended products!
- [Slack and You](./pages/slack.md): EVENTUALLY.
- Check the [Gist section](#code-snippets-tools-and-efficiency-tips) for more tips!

### Documentation

Writing is the ultimate skill.

- [How to Make the Most of Confluence](./pages/confluence.md): compendium.
- [Why ADRs Matter and How to Use Them](./pages/adrs.md): Document that will save you a lot of trouble down the line.
- [Writing Efficiently](./pages/writing.md)
- **IA Partially Generated**: too lazy to get into details, take them as source of inspiration.
    - [Requesting Assistance](./pages/advice-communications-assistance.md).
    - [Expressing Things](./pages/advice-communications-expressing-things.md).
    - [Expressions](./pages/advice-communications-expressions.md).

### Self-Help

Anything related to behavior, techniques and ways to improve yourself and others.

- [LEGOÂ® SERIOUS PLAYÂ® (LSP)](./pages/lsp): more useful than you would think.
- [Interviews and Work, Walkthrough Guide](./pages/ds-interviews): it won't land you a job right of the bat but it will definetily be more useful than many guides out there.
- [Troubleshooting](./pages/troubleshooting): knowing is the first step.
- **Communication**: EVENTUALLY.

<br>

### Mentoring

Personal suggestions to improve your quality of life at work.

- [Obsidian](./pages/obsidian.md): EVENTUALLY.
- [Digital Life](./pages/digital-life.md): EVENTUALLY.

<br>

### Theories and Thesis

Think of me talking like the Anakin parody of Seals Are Good.

- [The Core Five](./pages/thesis-the-core-five.md): EVENTUALLY.

<br>

### Meta

Learned stuff while doing other things.

- [Markdown](./pages/markdown): examples of interesting things that I had to use to make some pages from this site.
